# connect-sdk-rust

The 1Password Connect Rust SDK provides your Rust applications access to the 1Password Connect API hosted on your infrastructure and leverage the power of 1Password Secrets Automation

The library can be used by Rust applications, tools, and other automations to access and manage items in 1Password Vaults.

## Early draft, please wait for initial release

This is an early draft and is a work in progress.  I've posted this earlier so as to setup my crate
online.  Please wait for a proper release, which will be ready shortly; watch
this space for further updates.

## Installation

## Usage

1. Start by copying `.env-sample` to `.env`, making sure to update its values.
2. Follow the [instructions to start Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect) and make sure the Docker container starts at `http://localhost:8080`
3. Make sure to update `OP_API_TOKEN` in the `.env` file.


#### Basic API usage

```rust
use connect_1password::connect::Connect;

let connect = Connect::new();

// List vaults
let (vaults, _) = connect.vault().get_list().await?;

// Add a login item
let item: FullItem = LoginItemBuilder::new("vaultUUID")
    .username(&"Bob".to_string())
    .password(&"".to_string())
    .build();

let (new_item, _) = connect.item().add(item).await?;

// new_item = ItemData {
//     id: "feprs5zpzn7ck5hwvk5r6zunju",
//     title: "",
//     vault: VaultID {
//         id: "c6erdleqzhjlh4iu7ptwyd7hmy",
//     },
//     category: Some(
//         "LOGIN",
//     ),
//     urls: None,
//     favorite: None,
//     tags: None,
//     state: None,
//     created_at: Some(
//         2022-05-19T09:32:31.634125991Z,
//     ),
//     updated_at: Some(
//         2022-05-19T09:32:31.634126051Z,
//     ),
// }
```

Refer to the [docs](https://docs.rs/connect-1password/0.1.0/connect_1password/) for further examples.

### HTTPClient

Under the hood, [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/) is used with [hyper_rustls](https://docs.rs/hyper-rustls/latest/hyper_rustls/) which supports both HTTP and TLS connections out of the box.

### Plans for the future

- The current goal is to cover all existing API end-points, this should ideally not take too long
- Make the HTTP client pluggable
- TBD

## Development

### Running Tests

From repository root:

```shell script
cargo test
```

### Building

```shell script
cargo build --release
```

## This is not an official SDK

This Rust crate has been created solely by me and so far is not "officially" supported by the
awesome folk at 1Password.  This may change, maybe and if they would like to help out and/or adopt
this into the 1Password ecosystem, that would be nice as well.
