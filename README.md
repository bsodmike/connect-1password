The 1Password Connect Rust SDK provides your Rust applications access to the 1Password Connect API hosted on your infrastructure and leverage the power of 1Password Secrets Automation

## This is not an official SDK

This Rust crate has been created solely by me and so far is not "officially" supported by the
awesome folk at 1Password.  This may change, maybe and if they would like to help out and/or adopt
this into the 1Password ecosystem, that would be nice as well.
